-  Hi, I’m @convallaria48
-  I needed GitHub to do what I wanted to do.
-  I have very little IT knowledge. I did touch a raspberry pi for a while, but only found it surfing the net.
-  In the meantime, I am here to explore.
-  My username is the same as my Twitter ID, so if you need to contact me, that might be faster, but my English relies on automatic translation.
